# JLAB-File-Viewer
This is a file viewer for 3d files curated in the Visionarium Lab at Virginia Tech by myself, my PI (Dr. Nicholas Polys), and my colleague (Nicholas Gutkiowski). These are data files taken by Jefferson labs in Newport News VA of a particle collider and the exploding particles.
The specific point data for each of the files was left out for security purposes, however a link to the hosted file viewer is on my website.
